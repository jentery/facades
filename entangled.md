# Architecture as Entangled State

Earlier this month, at the University of Minnesota, I had the privilege of participating in ["Architecture as Catalyst."](http://arch.design.umn.edu/catalyst/) There, with [Andrea Johnson](http://arch.design.umn.edu/directory/johnsona/johnsona.htm), I facilitated a workshop titled, ["Reading Façades: Integrating Human and Computer Vision."](http://arch.design.umn.edu/catalyst/facades/) While planning the workshop, Johnson and I discussed how we might encourage speculative approaches to photogrammetry (i.e., recovering and stitching together surface points from a sequence of images) beyond re-presenting built environments. During these conversations, I returned to Tara McPherson's ["Media Studies and Digital Humanities"](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cj/summary/v048/48.2.mcpherson.html) for inspiration, and I started wondering whether photogrammetry's cultural implications might be best understood through photogrammetric experiments. In other words, how could we critique the technology through the technology? Of course, practice-based critiques are quite familiar to architects. And so the workshop participants, Johnson, and I hit the ground running, working with Agisoft PhotoScan, Rhino, Git, and tactile media to construct both digital and physical models. Below are two examples:

As the workshop unfolded, we started conceptualizing this experimental photogrammetry, developing a language for it. How should we describe what we're doing? When and why are the algorithms important? Why does photogrammetry matter, and for whom? What is it augmenting or complicating, and to what effects? When is it actually useful? Since the workshop, I've done my best to outline and describe experimental photogrammetry on paper, looking to Karen Barad's [*Meeting the Universe Halfway*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Meeting-the-Universe-Halfway) (2007, Duke UP) for foundations. Below is my first draft, anchored in the notion of "Architecture as Entangled State." As readers familiar with *Meeting the Universe Halfway* will likely know, entanglement is a framework Barad uses to examine the material and discursive elements of social practices. Personally, I find it quite applicable to studies of computing and culture, even if I'm still struggling to apply it persuasively. That said, during the next few months, I hope to better synthesize and test what's below. For now, I welcome any and all feedback. 

## Pattern, Not Mirror 

By no surprise, photogrammetry is generally used to re-present built environments. Instead of creating born-digital models through software such as Rhino, practitioners can algorithmically stitch together sequences of 2D images (of objects already in the world) into 3D models on screen. But this stitching process is not automagical. It involves a series of editorial choices, from selecting images and aligning them to manipulating 3D models during post-production. Thus, while photogrammetry enables the construction of high fidelity, physical models such as this one:

![FIGURE 3](figure3.png)

The models must be read as partly manual, partly automatic. In this case, the labor of translating a façade into an image dataset, then into an object file, and then into styrofoam, cannot be reduced to a whiz-bang translation of input into output. 

On screen or in hand, the photogrammetric models we made during Catalyst were not mirrors of reality. Using Barad's terms, they were more like congealed patterns of difference. Technically speaking, an application such as Agisoft PhotoScan marks differences between images and then aligns them. Without such differences, a model is difficult, if not impossible, to construct. Practically speaking, this means images and other objects are frequently manipulated prior to model-making. Yet the models themselves are also manipulative. As materials, they demand alteration of what's at hand: some digital files, some styrofoam, some paper. As discourse, they shape how we understand form and space. In this sense, they are neither "models of" (substitutes) nor "models for" (guides). (Here, see [McCarty](http://digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-2&toc.id=0&brand=9781405148641_brand) by way of Geertz.) They are "models through" (practices). They express contingent relations between entities instead of interpreting the world mimetically. 

## Difference, Not Sameness  

Distortion is a keyword of photogrammetry. Buildings are bent. Perspectives are warped. Environments are drippy. Paths are surreal. Light is diffracted. The question is whether practitioners find these distortions interesting or inconvenient. If you examine images such as this one: 

![FIGURE 4](figure4.png)

Or this one: 

![FIGURE 5](figure5.png)

Then you may explain them away through expertise: the environment is drippy because the technique demands more polish. With more time and practice, it would yield a more accurate representation of lived reality---a high fidelity model that isomorphically captures aspects of the world and renders them digitally. Yet this stance assumes that either photorealism or mimesis is the end-goal, and it risks relegating photogrammetry to a copy machine. 

If we understand distortions as features of (rather than exceptions to) a photogrammetric process, then we can also better express how people perceive, traverse, and experience space as well as built environments. In this case, who or what is gathering image data is fundamental to model-making. During Catalyst, we therefore experimented with multiple people modeling the same space. We also gathered image data collaboratively and stitched together models using an array of cameras and perspectives. Through these techniques, we could better identify when and why differences mattered for photogrammetric expression. In so doing, we also destabilized any assumptions that a universal or persistent vision (across time, space, and bodies) could be achieved computationally. The models were always contingent upon who and what were involved, when. At the same time, the models are like views from nowhere. 

![FIGURE 6](figure6.png) 

Perspectives are often difficult to attribute to particular people, and the boundaries between entities are consistently murky. To borrow from Barad (89), we witness the "intra-action" of nature and culture. The bends. The warps. The distortions. 

## Entangled, Not Separate 

To be sure, during Catalyst, our photogrammetry was quite performative, meaning "subject and object do not preexist as such, but emerge through intra-actions" (Barad 89). This involved not a small amount of field work: taking hundreds of photos on campus, for example. With cameras acting our as measuring instruments (or our boundary-makers), we quickly recognized how entangled our expression of Minnesota was with time of day, light, shadow, traffic, and class schedules. For me, the results evoke something between Foucault's panopticism and de Certeau's walks in the city:

![FIGURE 7](figure7.png) 

Or perhaps they fall somewhere on a play spectrum of poetry and design, of romantic creativity and systems thinking (Galloway 934). Whatever the gamut, experimental photogrammetry ultimately troubles any absolute separation between photographer and photograph, foreground and background, façade and environment, space and structure. Consequently, it is not easily interpreted through "reflexive" methodologies. As Barad suggests, the "knower / known binary" and the "ontology / epistemology binary" (Barad 89) typically require neat lines. In our case, the photogrammetry was grounded in participatory research; how the campus was measured happened through the conditions at play, meaning any claims for high fidelity representation, raw data, or objective distance would probably be disingenuous. 

As an alternative to reflection, Barad proposes "diffraction" via Donna Haraway. In photogrammetry, diffraction is associated with uncertainty, confusion, or obstacles. It results in a lack of image sharpness attributed to the use of small apertures during image creation. In a diffractive methodology, such confusion or uncertainty is underscored, not excised. Since subject-object relations are contingent, so, too, are any after-the-fact interpretations and memories. However, we need not discard objectivity altogether. As Barad argues, "objectivity is about being accountable to the specific materializations of which we are apart" (91). Perhaps, then, experimental photogrammetry is one way to study specific materializations of space and maintain accountability to them. 

![FIGURE 8](figure8.png) 

True, images such as the one above do not represent how architecture is actually perceived, or how it is actually built. Still, we could argue that they express how built environments are practiced---how, for example, specific people intra-act with specific materials while traversing space. These contingencies cannot be reduced to the social construction of space, and they are not matters of physical structures alone, hence Barad's interests in relational ontology. During Catalyst, we attempted to express this ontology abstractly by translating aligned photos and point clouds into decimated models such as this one of X on the Minnesota campus:  

![FIGURE 9](figure9.png) 

And this one of Y, also on campus: 

![FIGURE 10](figure10.png) 

One outcome of this approach was to question how detailed models must be in order to communicate the relevance of entangled states. That is, when is an abstract model more persuasive than a photorealistic one? Or what is the correlation between "specific materializations" and granularity? Another outcome was visualizing how boundaries are blurred and then using those visualizations to discuss architecture as an entanglement. Once façades, paths, and natural environments become part of a single face in a decimated model, discursive binaries such as interior / exterior, inside / outside, and surface / depth no longer hold. In their place, we started using words such as slope, gradient, periphery, field, traversal, detachment, migration, hesitation, and affordance. 

With more research, perhaps such decimations could prompt scholars to conjecture when and where "real material differences" (Barad 89) in built environments emerge, not to mention why they matter. Again, with experimental photogrammetry, the issue is not the actual perception or construction of built environments. It is articulating architecture as an entangled state and, beyond that, determining how entanglements shape everyday practices, from how people interpret and use built environments to how spaces are value-laden and affective. While it may be tempting to simply stand in awe of the strange, "withdrawn" expressions of experimental photogrammetry, scholars could instead create them with the intent to better understand how the world is routinely and subtly manipulated beyond familiar binaries. 

## Reading Through, Not Against 

And then there's Lefebvre (1974). As an imaginative expression steeped in the particulars of data, experimental photogrammetry is a representational space entangled with spatial practices (e.g., rhythms and habits) as well as representations of space (e.g., plans and maps). It is at once messy and abstract; it repeatedly refers to lived reality without ever representing it. 

Yet it is also a way of reading through engagement, of accounting for entangled states instead of aiming for remove (Barad 90). Recently, scholars such as [Rita Felski](http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/viewArticle/431) have called for more attention to the "immersive and affective dimensions" of reading, and it seems as if critical approaches to computer vision and photogrammetry actively demand such dimensions. Otherwise, they risk becoming too conceptual, too symbolic, too secondary, too programmatic, too cold. For humanities scholars including myself, such gestures may involve expanding discursive methodologies to better account for what Barad calls "patterns of mattering" (140), where discourse and matter exist relationally, not causally. 

After all, as Johnson reminded me throughout Catalyst, we shouldn't be too quick to parse the world into *les mots et les choses*. There is a long history of writing entangled with façades, of text translated into architecture, of words becoming things. The lines are muddy. But the differences are always made to matter.     

## Thank You

A million thanks to Andrea Johnson for inviting me to Catalyst, for teaching with me, and for leading events throughout the week. A million additional thanks to the workshop's participants, all of whom went above and beyond: Jeremy Bernardy, Samuel Daley, Xin Hu, Erica Hway, George Liu, Christopher Massey, and Dustin Schipper. Finally, thanks to the University of Minnesota's School of Architecture for its tremendous support. Architecture as Catalyst was an inspiring coincidence of shared interests and diverse investments---a model for how transdisciplinary practice happens and why it's important.
