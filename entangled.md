# Architecture as Entangled State

Earlier this month, at the University of Minnesota, I had the privilege of participating in ["Architecture as Catalyst"](http://arch.design.umn.edu/catalyst/). There, with [Andrea Johnson](http://arch.design.umn.edu/directory/johnsona/johnsona.htm), I facilitated a workshop titled, ["Reading Façades: Integrating Human and Computer Vision."](http://arch.design.umn.edu/catalyst/facades/) While planning the workshop, Johnson and I discussed how we might encourage speculative approaches to photogrammetric computer vision in order to do something other than re-present the built environment. During these conversations, I returned to Tara McPherson's ["Media Studies and Digital Humanities"](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cj/summary/v048/48.2.mcpherson.html) for inspiration, and I started wondering how the cultural and theoretical implications of photogrammetry (i.e., recovering and stitching together surface points from a sequence of images) might be understood through actual photogrammetric experiments. In other words, how to critique the technology through the technology? Of course, practice-based critiques are quite familiar to architects. And so the workshop participants, Johnson, and I hit the ground running, working primarily with Agisoft PhotoScan, Rhino, and Git to construct both digital and physical models. Below are two examples:

As the workshop unfolded, we started articulating ways to conceptualize speculative computer vision and experimental photogrammetry. How do we describe what we're doing with images, software, and algorithms? Why does it matter, and for whom? What is it augmenting or complicating, and to what effects? Since the workshop, I've done my best to outline and describe some concepts on paper, looking to Karen Barad's [*Meeting the Universe Halfway*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Meeting-the-Universe-Halfway) (2007, Duke UP) for a foundation. Below is my first attempt, anchored in the notion of "Architecture as Entangled State." As readers familiar with *Meeting the Universe Halfway* will likely know, entanglement is the framework through which Barad approaches the material and discursive elements of social practices. Personally, I find it quite applicable to studies of computational culture, even if I'm still unpacking how to communicate it concisely. That said, during the next few months, I hope to better synthesize and test what's below. For now, I welcome any and all feedback. 

## Pattern, Not Mirror 

By no surprise, computer vision and photogrammetry are generally used to re-present the built environment. As opposed to creating born-digital models through software such as Rhino, practitioners can algorithmically stitch together sequences of 2D images (of objects already in the world) into 3D models. Yet this stitching process is not auto-magical. It involves a series of editorial choices, from selecting images and aligning them to manipulating 3D models during post-production. Thus, while photogrammetry enables the construction of high fidelity, physical models such as this one:

![FIGURE 3](figure3.png)

The models must be read as partly manual, partly automatic. In this case, the labor of transducing the textures of a façade into an image dataset, and then into an object file, and then into styrofoam cannot be reduced to a tidy, computational translation of input into output. 

On screen or in hand, the photogrammetric model is not a mirror of reality. Instead, it emerges, as matter, from differences (e.g., between Image A and Image B) that are marked and stitched together by people and machines. Put this way, we may best describe photogrammetric models as difference patterns. Thinking of [McCarty](http://digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-2&toc.id=0&brand=9781405148641_brand) by way of Geertz, perhaps they are neither "models of" (a substitute) nor "models for" (a guide). They are "models through" which we intervene in the world, both materially and discursively. (I believe this position corresponds with Barad's take on Ian Hacking's work. See Barad 50.) As materials, models manipulate what's at hand: the digital file, the styrofoam, the image. As discourse, they shape how we understand, say, form and space. They express contingent relations between entities instead of interpreting the world mimetically. Maybe, then, they are closer to compilers than raw files. They translate this into that. 

## Difference, Not Sameness  

Distortion is the keyword of photogrammetry. Buildings are bent. Perspectives are warped. Environments are drippy. Paths are surreal. Light is diffracted. The question is whether practitioners find these distortions interesting or inconvenient. If you examine images such as this one: 

![FIGURE 4](figure4.png)

Then you might be inclined to explain them away through expertise: the environment is drippy because the technique demands more polish. With more time and practice, it would yield a more accurate representation of lived reality---a high fidelity model that isomorphically captures aspects of the world and renders them digitally. Yet this stance assumes photorealism or mimesis is the end-goal of the research, and it risks ignoring how photogrammetry is more than a copy machine. If we understand distortions as features of (rather than exceptions to) a photogrammetric process, then we can also better express how people perceive, traverse, and experience both space and the built environment. Who or what is gathering the image data is fundamental to model-making. During Catalyst, we therefore experimented with multiple people modeling the same space. We also gathered image data collaboratively and stitched together models using an array of cameras and perspectives. Of course, the time of day, not to mention the presence of light and shadow, were also significant. Through these techniques, we could better identify when and why differences mattered for photogrammetric expression. In so doing, we also destabilized any assumptions that a universal or persistent vision (across time, space, and bodies) could actually be achieved via computer vision. The models were always contingent upon who and what were involved, when. At the same time, they are views from nowhere. That is, parsing subjects from objects in the images is never easy. To borrow from Barad (89), the image data became an "intra-action" of nature and culture, not an abstraction mirroring reality.   

## Entangled, Not Separate 

Indeed, our photogrammetry research during Catalyst was frequently described as performative: "subject and object do not preexist as such, but emerge through intra-actions" (Barad 89). Images such as the one below evoke something between Foucault's panopticism and de Certeau's walks in the city (tho my own biases lean toward Foucault):

![FIGURE 5](figure5.png) 

Or, if we interpret them as play, then we have much to learn from Galloway's articulation of romanticism (e.g., creative tinkering) and systems theory (e.g., balance and flow) in "The Unworkable Interface" (933-34). Here, photogrammetry falls somewhere on the play spectrum of poetry and design  (934). Yet most relevant to Barad's work, it affords a way of thinking through the blurring of boundaries, or the impossibility of any absolute separation, of any clean line, between subject and object, foreground and background, façade and environment, space and structure. By extension, "reflexivity" may not be the most persuasive methodology for this sort of inquiry. After all, as Barad suggests, the "knower | known binary" or the "ontology | epistemology binary" (Barad 89) are too neat to describe material engagements. With reflexivity, there is a sense of distance from what was made, and often data is evaluated for accuracy or fidelity. 

As an alternative, Barad proposes "diffraction" (via Donna Haraway). Of course, in photogrammetry research, diffraction is associated with uncertainty, confusion, or obstacles. It results in a lack of image sharpness attributed to the use of small apertures during image creation. In a diffractive methodology, such confusion or uncertainty is underscored, not excised. Since subject-object relations are contingent, so, too, are any after-the-fact interpretations and memories. But to be clear, this position does not discard objectivity altogether. As Barad argues, "objectivity is about being accountable to the specific materializations of which we are apart" (91). Perhaps experimental photogrammetry is one way to examine these specific materializations and maintain an accountability to them. 

![FIGURE 6](figure6.png) 

After all, images such as the one above do not represent how architecture is actually perceived, or how it is actually built. However, we could argue that they express how the built environment is practiced---how, for example, specific people intra-act with specific materials while traversing space. These contingencies cannot be reduced to the social construction of space, and collectively they are not a matter of structures alone. During Catalyst, we attempted to express them abstractly, translating aligned photos and point clouds into decimated models such as this one, of X on the University of Minnesota campus:  

![FIGURE 7](figure7.png) 

And this one, of Y, also on campus: 

![FIGURE 8](figure8.png) 

One outcome of this approach is to question how detailed specific materializations must be in order to communicate the relevance of entanglements. Another outcome is a visualization of how boundaries are blurred. Once façades, paths, and natural environments become part of a single face in a decimated model, binaries such as interior|exterior, inside|outside, and surface|depth no longer hold. Or, they are not persuasive. Instead, we started using words such as slope, gradient, periphery, field, traversal, detachment, migration, hesitation, and affordance to describe space and architecture. With more research, perhaps such decimations could prompt practitioners to conjecture where "real material differences" (Barad 89) in the lived, built environment emerge. Again, maybe the issue here is about actual perception or actual construction; it is entanglement of materials and social relations that shape everyday practice. Instead of standing in awe or wonder of computer vision and its "withdrawn," photogrammetric objects, we could create them to help us better understand how the world is routinely and subtly manipulated. 

## Reading Through, Not Reading Against 

Echoing Lefebvre (1974), as an imaginative expression steeped in data, experimental photogrammetry is a representational space entangled (or perhaps layered) with spatial practices (e.g., rhythms and habits) as well as representations of space (e.g., plans and maps). It is at once messy and abstract. It is also a way of reading through, rather than against, engagement (Barad 90). Recently, scholars such as [Rita Felski](http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/viewArticle/431) have called for more attention to the "immersive and affective dimensions" of reading, and it seems as if critical approaches to computer vision and photogrammetry actively demand such reading. Otherwise, they risk becoming too conceptual, too symbolic, too secondary, too cold. 

As Johnson reminded me throughout Catalyst, we shouldn't be too quick to  conveniently parse the world into *les mots et les choses*. There is a long history of writing entangled with façade, of text becoming architecture, of words translated into things. The lines are muddy. But the differences are always made to matter.     

## Thank You

A million thanks to Andrea Johnson for inviting me to Catalyst, for teaching with me, and for leading events throughout the week. A million more thanks to the workshop's participants, all of whom went above and beyond: NAMES. Finally, thanks to the University of Minnesota's School of Architecture for its tremendous support. Architecture as Catalyst was an inspiring coincidence of shared interests and diverse investments---a model for how transdisciplinary practice happens and why it matters.
